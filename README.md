# Welcome to Kessia's GitHub Repository! âœ¨

## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Kessia, a data enthusiast with a passion for unraveling insights from complex datasets. I have a background in marketing management, app store optimization and marketing analytics but I'm currently making the transition into the world of data and artificial intelligence. My journey is fueled by a fascination with deep learning, particularly in its applications to environmental domains like weather forecasting.

## What You'll Find Here
Here on my Github I've gathered a collection of projects that showcase my exploration into various aspects of data analytics, data science, and AI. Each project represents a step in my learning journey, from data wrangling to advanced modeling techniques.

## Project Highlights
- [Data Analysis Practise Projects](https://github.com/Kessiia/data_analytics_projects.git): a collection of data analysis projects I did to refine my skills and to take the reader along to show how I work with data. I am updating this repository regularly with new projects.
- [Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/Kessiia/python-data-analysis.git): in this repository I demonstrate the skills I've learned through various Python for Data Analysis courses. I update this repository regularly with new things I've learned, so please be sure to check it out!

## Next Up
- I'm currently working on two exciting data analysis projects during my free time, both focused on analyzing extreme weather data. My interest in understanding the development and societal/natural impacts of extreme weather is a key driver behind one of these initiatives. I really enjoy going down deep rabbit holes online, where one interesting link leads to another, and before you know it, I've stumbled upon a treasure trove of interconnected information during my data explorations. Both projects in a nutshell:
  1. I am analysing historical extreme weather events data to understand their frequency, intensity, and impact on different regions. On of the main questions I hope to answer is: 'How have extreme weather events evolved over time, and what regions are most affected?
  2. I am also looking at climate change data to understand its impact on regions not accustomed to extreme weather events. I am curious to know how climate change is affecting regions that are not traditionally prone to extreme weather events.

 I am hoping to create a respository for both of these projects soon. So stay tuned!

## Seeking Opportunities
I'm actively seeking opportunities to leverage my skills in data analytics, data science, and AI. Whether it's an entry-level position, or a challenging project, I'm eager to contribute and grow in a dynamic environment.

## Let's Connect!
If you're interested in collaborating, discussing projects, know just the right job for me, or just connecting with a fellow data enthusiast, I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kessiananuru/) to start a conversation.

## Conclusion
Thank you for taking the time to explore my GitHub repository! I hope you find my projects inspiring and informative. Stay tuned for more updates and exciting projects as I continue to evolve in the fascinating world of data, AI and deep learning.
